# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository explores the **requirement analysis phase** in software development â€” one of the most critical steps in ensuring that a project aligns with user needs and business goals.

It covers:
- Understanding user and stakeholder requirements
- Defining functional and non-functional requirements
- Creating requirement documentation
- Tools and techniques used during requirement gathering and analysis

This project serves as a foundation for understanding how clear and accurate requirements drive successful software delivery.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining what a software system should do. It focuses on understanding the needs and expectations of end users, stakeholders, and the business to ensure the final product solves the right problem.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and clients collaborate to answer key questions such as:
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- Who will use the system?
- What features and functionalities are required?
- What constraints or limitations exist?

### ðŸ”¹ Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Requirement Analysis is a **crucial foundation** of the SDLC because it directly influences the projectâ€™s success. Hereâ€™s why it matters:

1. **Clarity and Alignment:** It ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s goals and scope.
2. **Reduced Rework:** Well-defined requirements minimize costly changes and misunderstandings later in development.
3. **Accurate Planning:** Clear requirements help project managers estimate time, budget, and resources effectively.
4. **Quality Assurance:** It provides measurable criteria for testing and validation, ensuring the final product meets user needs.
5. **Better Communication:** Acts as a bridge between clients, developers, and testers, promoting transparency throughout the project.
